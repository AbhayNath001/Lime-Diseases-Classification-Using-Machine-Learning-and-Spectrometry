Spectral Analysis of Lime Leaves: Advancing Lyme Disease Detection at CHARUSAT

<h3>
This dataset was meticulously created at the Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) as part of a comprehensive research project aimed at advancing the detection and analysis of Lyme disease. The data was generated using a high-precision spectrometer, where lime leaf samples were analyzed to detect biomarkers associated with the disease. Each sample was carefully prepared and tested under controlled laboratory conditions, with readings taken across multiple spectrometric wavelengths. The resulting dataset provides detailed spectral information, capturing variations in absorbance and reflectance that are crucial for developing predictive models and improving diagnostic accuracy for Lyme disease. The CHARUSAT research team ensured the dataset's reliability by adhering to strict protocols and conducting multiple trials to validate the results.

The dataset consists of six distinct datasets: Datasets 1 to 4 contain data from diseased lime leaves, while Datasets 5 and 6 contain data from normal lime leaves.
